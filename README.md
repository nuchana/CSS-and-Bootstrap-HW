# Challenges

* I have mastered CSS and bootstrap and understood better how to customize the bootstrap templates. I also learnt how to use fontawesome to create some special icons which was something I didn't know about when I firstly worked on this assignment 2 months ago.

* Download link, special icons, html links and Javascript combination were difficult but need to googlefu to sort them out. 

* Bootstrap is very useful but I need to be mindful about using it as I need to put my own touch into the design as well.
