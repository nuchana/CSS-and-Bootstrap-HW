          I have been a marketer creating consumer brands and goods for over 8 years and now I am looking for 
          a new adventure of a career shift. Coding has become my main interest because I am excited by new 
          innovations and applications created by coders. These offer a real solution to consumers and users. That has inspired me to be a part of this career journey.
          I enjoy creating tangible products in my current line of work and shifting to coding will be exciting and challenging as I will create and build intangible work 
          that can be used in everyday life through digital coding. 
        </p>

        <p>
          I am originally from Bangkok, Thailand and I have been moving around USA, Spain, Thailand, and Singapore in the last 10 years. 
          Partly, it was for my study and work that I had to move and travel. I love travelling, meeting new people and experiencing 
          new cultures. Tennis and scuba diving are my go-to hobbies when I have free time; however, moving to USA in the east coast
          is not easy to find a place for scuba diving. The water temperature can be freezing even in the summer month!
        </p>

        <P>
          My journey in digital coding has just begun and can't wait to learn more about building my new skills in the next
          6 months. I am a full-time employee and taking a new program can be daunting and definitely out of my comfort zone
          but if I do not take my chance now, I will regret for not pursuing it for sure.
        </P>
